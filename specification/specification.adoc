= Confetti Specification
Version 1.0-beta.4
:doctype: book
:toc:

This specification defines **version 1.0-beta.4** of Confetti.

NOTE: Confetti is stable.
If you discover bugs in this specification, then please report them to the https://github.com/hgs3/confetti/issues[project's issue tracker].

== Introduction

**This clause is informative.**

Confetti is a configuration language intended for human-editable configuration files.
It is minimalistic, untyped, and unopinionated.

This specification defines the core language for Confetti, but does not assign semantic meaning to it.
Assigning semantic meaning is the responsibility of the Confetti user.

Confetti is designed to be minimal and extensible.
Similar to how various flavors of Markdown exist, implementations can introduce custom Confetti extensions by extending the grammar.
Official extensions can be found in the <<_annex_a_comment_syntax_extension,annex>> of this specification.
These extensions provide a syntactic framework for extending Confetti in a way compatible with its grammar.

The <<_implementation_scope,implementation scope>> section of this specification formally defines how implementation authors can deviate from this specification while still claiming conformance.
For example, implementations are allowed to limit support to only ASCII-compatible Unicode characters.

The Confetti grammar has been designed to allow for incremental processing.
That means the entire Confetti source text does not need to be loaded into memory in order to process Confetti correctly.
Incremental processing can be implemented by processing the arguments of a single directive _before_ processing the next directive or subdirectives.

Implementation authors are encouraged to test their implementations against the https://github.com/hgs3/confetti/blob/master/tests/CONFORMANCE.md[official conformance test suite].

== General Representation

**This clause is informative.**

Confetti source text can be modeled with two interfaces: one representing the configuration unit, and the other representing an individual directive.
What follows is a pseudocode description of these interfaces intended to help implementation authors conceptualize Confetti.

These interfaces are **illustrative only**.
Implementation authors should translate Confetti source text into data structures best suited to their programming language or runtime environment.

The first interface, the configuration unit, represents the Confetti source text as a whole.
It consists of zero or more top-level directives.

[source,conf]
----
interface ConfigurationUnit {
    topLevelDirectives: Directive[]
}
----

The second interface, the directive, represents a top-level directive or a subdirective.
Each directive has one or more arguments and zero or more subdirectives.

[source,conf]
----
interface Directive {
    arguments: string[]
    subdirectives: Directive[]
}
----

The remainder of this specification formally defines the lexical and grammar rules for processing Confetti-conformant source text into these interfaces.

**End of informative text.**

== Conformance

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119[RFC 2119].
However, for readability, these words do not appear in all uppercase letters in this specification.

All text in this specification is normative unless explicitly marked as informative or shown as an example.

== Lexical Structure

Confetti-conformant source text is formally known as a _configuration unit_.
Although a configuration unit might have a one-to-one correspondence with a file in a file system, such correspondence is not required.

A configuration unit shall consist of zero or more Unicode scalar values.
This specification does not mandate a specific Unicode character encoding form.

=== Forbidden Characters

Forbidden characters are Unicode scalar values with general category `Control`, `Surrogate`, and `Unassigned`, excluding characters with the `Whitespace` property.

Forbidden characters must not appear in a configuration unit.

=== White Space

White space characters are Unicode characters with the `Whitespace` property, excluding <<_line_terminators,line terminators>>.
// White space rules are derived from the `isspace` property as defined in https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr18/#Compatibility_Properties[Annex C: Compatibility Properties in Unicode Technical Report #18].

=== Comments

Comments must begin with a `&#35;` and continue until a <<_line_terminators,line terminator>> or EOF is found.

All Unicode characters should be permitted in comments excluding <<_forbidden_characters,forbidden characters>>.

.Example: Comment.
[source,conf]
----
# This is a comment.
----

=== Line Terminators

Line terminators are defined by the Unicode standard and are listed in the following table.
// Unicode Technical Report #31 requires certain line terminators to prevent line spoofing (these are the line terminators this specification requires).

For compatibility with Windows operating systems, implementations may treat the sequence Carriage Return (U+000D) followed by Line Feed (U+000A) as a single, indivisible new line character sequence.

=== Directive

A configuration unit shall consist of zero or more _directives_.

==== Simple Directive

A simple directive shall be represented as a sequence of one or more <<_argument,arguments>>.

A simple directive must be terminated by a character from the <<_line_terminators,line terminator>> character set or a Semicolon (U+003B).

.Example: Simple directive with two arguments.
[source,conf]
----
username jsmith
----

==== Block Directive

A block directive shall be a sequence of one or more <<_argument,arguments>>, zero or more <<_line_terminators,line terminators>>, and a subdirective block.

A subdirective block shall be a sequence of zero or more directives enclosed in curly braces.
The subdirective block begins with a Left Curly Bracket (U+007B) and terminates with a Right Curly Bracket (U+007D).

A subdirective block may be succeeded by a Semicolon (U+003B).

.Example: Composite directive with one subdirective.
[source,conf]
----
application {
    version 1.2.3 <1>
}
----
<1> Subdirective with two arguments: `version` and `1.2.3`

=== Argument

An argument shall be a sequence of one or more characters from the argument character set.
The argument character set shall consist of any Unicode scalar value excluding characters from the <<_white_space,white space>>, <<_line_terminators,line terminator>>, <<_reserved_punctuators,reserved punctuator>>, and <<_forbidden_characters,forbidden>> character sets.
// This definition is derived from the `isgraph` property as defined in https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr18/#Compatibility_Properties[Annex C: Compatibility Properties in Unicode Technical Report #18].

The value of an argument shall be the argument’s lexeme with <<_escaped_characters,escaped characters>> and <<_line_continuation,line continuations>> processed.

=== Quoted Argument

A quoted argument shall be an argument enclosed in Quotation Marks (U+0022).

==== Single-Quoted Argument

A single-quoted argument must begin with a leading punctuator Quotation Mark (U+0022), followed by zero or more single-quoted argument characters, and terminated by the trailing punctuator Quotation Mark (U+0022).

The single-quoted argument character set shall be the union of the argument character set and <<_white_space,white space>> character set.

The value of a single-quoted argument shall be the argument’s lexeme with <<_escaped_characters,escaped characters>> processed, leading and trailing Quotation Mark (U+0022) removed, and <<_line_continuation,line continuations>> processed.

.Example: Directive with a single-quoted argument.
[source,conf]
----
name "John Smith, Jr."
----

==== Triple-Quoted Argument

A triple-quoted argument must begin with three consecutive leading punctuator Quotation Mark (U+0022), followed by zero or more characters from the triple-quoted argument character set, and terminated by the trailing punctuator Quotation Mark (U+0022).

The triple-quoted argument character set shall be the union of the argument character set, the <<_white_space,white space>> character set, and the <<_line_terminators,line terminator>> character set.

The value of a triple-quoted argument shall be the argument’s lexeme with <<_escaped_characters,escaped characters>> processed and the leading and trailing triple Quotation Mark (U+0022) characters removed.

.Example: Directive with a triple-quoted argument.
[source,conf]
----
execute """function() {
  console.log("Hello, World!")
}"""
----

=== Escaped Characters

When a Reverse Solidus (U+005C) appears in an argument, a single-quoted argument, or a tripled quoted argument, it must be succeeded by a Unicode character 'C'.
Unicode character 'C' shall be any Unicode scalar value except <<_white_space,white space>>, <<_line_terminators,line terminators>>, and <<_forbidden_characters,forbidden characters>>.

The Reverse Solidus (U+005C) and character 'C' are together labeled as an _escaped character_.
An escaped character is interpreted as if the character 'C' replaces the reverse solidus and 'C' character.

The escaped character shall not be interpreted as a <<_reserved_punctuators,reserved punctuator>> in any context.

=== Line Continuation

When the last argument of a directive is a Reverse Solidus (U+005C) succeeded by a <<_line_terminators,line terminator>>, the implementation shall delete the reverse solidus and line terminator and continue processing arguments for the directive.

.Example: Multi-line directive.
[source,conf]
----
probe-device eth0 \ <1>
eth1
----
<1> Directive with three arguments: `probe-device`, `eth0`, and `eth1`

Between the Quotation Marks (U+0022) of a single-quoted argument, when a Reverse Solidus (U+005C) immediately precedes a <<_line_terminators,line terminator>>, the implementation shall delete the reverse solidus and line terminator and continue processing single-quoted argument characters.
// Triple-quoted arguments do not require line continuation characters, as they are inherently multi-line.

.Example: Line continuation in a single-quoted argument.
[source,conf]
----
message "Hello, \ <1>
World!"
----
<1> Directive with two arguments: `message` and `Hello, World!`

== Grammar

The formal grammar:

[source,ebnf]
----
configuration-unit = <directives>
        directives = { <simple-directive> | <block-directive> | <newline-char> }
  simple-directive = <arguments> ( <newline-char> | `;` )
   block-directive = <arguments> { <newline-char> } <block> [ `;` ]
             block = `{` <directives> `}`
         arguments = <argument> { <argument> }
          argument = <simple-argument> | <quoted-argument>
   simple-argument = <argument-char> { <argument-char> }
   quoted-argument = <single-quoted> | <triple-quoted>
     single-quoted = `"` { <argument-char> | <space-char> } `"`
     triple-quoted = `"""` { <argument-char> | <space-char> | <newline-char> } `"""`
----

The lexical grammar:

[source,ebnf]
----
     argument-char = [^ \p{Whitespace} \p{Control} \p{Surrogate} \p{Unassigned} ]
      newline-char = [ \u000A \u000B \u000C \u000D \u0085 \u2028 \u2029 ]
        space-char = [ [ \p{Whitespace} ] - [ <newline-char> ] ]
----

== Implementation Scope

Implementations may impose limits on the number of Unicode scalar values that may appear in a configuration unit.

Implementations may impose limits on the number of directives a configuration unit may have.

Implementations may impose limits on the number of arguments a directive may have.

Implementations may impose limits on the number of Unicode scalar values that an argument may have.

Implementations may impose limits on the maximum nesting depth of block directives.

Implementations may reject configuration units with Unicode bidirectional formatting characters.
// The appearance of Unicode bidirectional formatting characters in comments can lead to spoofing, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_Source[Trojan Source].

Implementations may extend or restrict the Unicode character sets defined by this specification, on the condition that any changes are thoroughly documented.
// Rational: an implementation might only want ASCII.

Implementations may extend this specification, on the condition that any additions are thoroughly documented.

== Normative References

This specification is written against the Unicode Standard version 16.0.
It is possible newer standards may necessitate a revision of this specification.

This specification defines formal grammar rules using EBNF as defined in ISO/IEC 14977:1996.

This specification defines lexical grammar rules using Unicode character set notation as defined in Unicode Technical Standard #35.

== Annex A: Comment Syntax Extension

Implementations may include a comment syntax based on C language conventions where multi-line comments are enclosed in `/\*` and `*/` and single-line comments begin with `//`.

Single-line comments must behave identically to `&#35;` comments.

Valid multi-line comments must begin with a `/\*` and continue until a `*/` is found.

The following table extends the <<_reserved_punctuators,reserved punctuator>> table.

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Name |Description

|`//`
|Two Solidus (U+002F U+002F)

|`/*`
|Solidus Asterisk (U+002F U+002A)

|`*/`
|Asterisk Solidus (U+002A U+002F)
|===

== Annex B: Expression Arguments Extension

Implementations may support _expression arguments_.
An expression argument is a user-defined expression that may appear wherever an <<_argument,argument>> is permitted.
The interpretation and evaluation of an expression argument is implementation defined.

This extension requires Left Parenthesis (U+0028) and Right Parenthesis (U+0029) to be interpreted as <<_reserved_punctuators,reserved punctuators>>.
If an implementation permits parenthesis in the expression argument, then they must be _balanced_ — that is, for every Left Parenthesis (U+0028), there must be a succeeding Right Parenthesis (U+0029).

The value of an expression argument is the enclosed content with the outer parentheses removed.

The production rules shall be amended as follows:

[source,ebnf]
----
           argument ::= <simple-argument> | <quoted-argument> | <expression-argument>
expression-argument ::= `(` ? implementation defined ? `)`
----

.Example: Compute a mathematical equation.
[source,conf]
----
compute (1 + (2 * 3)) <1>
----
<1> A directive with two arguments: `compute` and `1 + (2 * 3)`.

.Example: Branch with conditional expression.
[source,conf]
----
if ($username == "joe") { <1>
    print "Hi, Joe."
}
----
<1> A directive with two arguments: `if` and `$username == "joe"`. The second argument is a user-defined expression.

== Annex C: Punctuator Arguments Extension

Implementations may define their own _punctuator arguments_.
A punctuator argument is a self-delimiting argument that may appear wherever an <<_argument,argument>> is permitted.

Punctuator arguments shall consist of one or more characters from the <<_argument,argument character set>>.

Punctuator arguments must be self-delimiting; that is, they are treated as a single argument.
Adjacent characters must not contribute to the punctuator argument, even if they would under standard interpretation.

The production rules shall be amended as follows:

[source,ebnf]
----
           argument ::= <simple-argument> | <quoted-argument> | <punctuator-argument>
punctuator-argument ::= ? implementation defined ?
----

.Example: Using ':=' as a punctuator argument.
[source,conf]
----
user:=smith <1>
----
<1> If `:=` is interpreted as a punctuator argument, then the directive has three arguments: `user`, `:=`, and `smith`. Under standard interpretation, there is only one argument: `user:=smith`.
